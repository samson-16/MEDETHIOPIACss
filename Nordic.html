                            The ER team works closely with the NMC Emergency Call Centre and ambulance crew.

                            The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a specialist ward that is designed to handle the needs of critically ill patients. 
                            Our team of medical specialists is on standby round the clock to treat patients requiring intensive and emergency care.
                            
                            
                            The ICU has a total of 8 beds – 5 fully equipped intensive care beds and 
                            3 ‘step-down’ beds for patients transitioning out of intensive care. In addition, 
                            we also operate an isolation room prepared to admit a patient with a serious infectious disease at very short notice.</p>

                            <p>
                              Our two operating theatres are open 24/7 to cater for scheduled surgeries as well as emergency cases. 
                              The theatre team is made up of highly skilled and experienced surgeons, anaesthetists, theatre nurses and technicians.</p>
                             <p>We are now equipped to carry out major surgeries including trauma cases, general surgery, laparoscopic surgery,
                               chest surgery and vascular surgery. We aim to treat patients at NMC if possible, but the surgical team can also stabilize
                                critically ill trauma patients for medical evacuation if necessary.

                              Our surgical team has the capability to perform minimally invasive surgery when needed which for patients means shorter
                               hospital stays, less medication, 
                              shorter periods of recovery, and a faster return to normal activity</p>
